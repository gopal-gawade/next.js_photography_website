            Hello. I’m Suyog Vilankar
          </h1>
          <p className={pt_sans.className}>
            I’m a civil engineer by degree (Class of 2018), but a photographer
            by passion. Though I started my journey in civil engineering, my
            heart has always been behind the camera. In 2020, I turned that
            lifelong interest into a serious pursuit, and since then, I’ve had
            the privilege of capturing countless weddings, pre-wedding moments,
            and other cherished life events. My goal is simple: to deliver
            stunning, heartfelt photographs that preserve your special memories
            — all at an affordable price. I believe in building trust through
            quality and commitment, and I promise you won’t be disappointed.
            Let’s create something beautiful together.
          </p>
