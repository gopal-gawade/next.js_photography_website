                I’m Suyog Vilankar — a civil engineer by degree, but a photographer by
                heart. While my journey began in engineering, it was in 2020 that I
                decided to follow my true passion: capturing real moments, real
                emotions, and real stories through the lens. Since then, I’ve had the
                honor of photographing countless weddings, pre-wedding sessions, and
                life’s most beautiful celebrations. What you see on this page isn't just
                photography — it's trust, emotion, laughter, and love, all frozen in
                time. Couples like you allowed me into their most important days, and I
                carry that responsibility with pride and gratitude. I believe every
                story is unique, and my goal is to tell yours in a way that feels true
                and timeless. From the smallest glance to the biggest smile, I focus on
                capturing the genuine moments that matter most. Weddings aren’t just
                events to me — they’re stories waiting to be told with heart, honesty,
                and artistry. And through every frame, I aim to preserve not just how it
                looked, but how it felt. If you feel a connection to my work, let’s
                connect — and together, we’ll create something truly unforgettable.
